{"name":"MarkdownReports","tagline":"An R function library to generate (scientific) reports easily.","body":"\r\n\r\n[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.45945.svg)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.45945)\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is ***MarkdownReports***?\r\n\r\nMarkdownReports is a set of **R** functions that allows you to generate neat reports / summaries what you discovered with your script. It helps you to:\r\n\r\n1. Write down your findings easily in a clear and nicely formatted way.\r\n- Support your findings with quick & pretty figures saved along your report\r\n- Link and show these in your markdown or html document, *at the right spot*.\r\n- Share your findings with others via email, github or a personal website.\r\n\r\n \r\n## Why did I make it & why might you like it?\r\n\r\nI do exploratory data analysis as a daily routine and I have constant interaction with all sorts of people: supervisors, collaborators, colleagues, etc. \r\n\r\nI often have to...\r\n\r\n1. ... write emails summarizing the results (text accompanied by figures) of the last few days.\r\n2. ...find back results a couple of month back, with all tiny details (parameters used, etc)\r\n3. ...assemble each step I did that day into a logical story line, that others can follow right as they see it, e.g.: *I observed X; I controlled for Y; Hypothesized explanation A; Falsified it; Came up with explanation B; Tested & proven it...*\r\n\t\r\nFor all of the above, my solution is MarkdownReports. I think its better than other solutions I found. Many of those like to combine source code with results, and many are too complex to use. Most of people I interact with are not interested in code, but are very keen on seeing my results from all possible angles and are asking detailed questions about the analysis.\r\n\r\n### Where does ***MarkdownReports*** stand out?\r\n\r\n- Pure markdown output, simple and elegant layout.\r\n- Handy integration of text with figures (linked to an external file & displayed: makes manual tailoring easy)\r\n- Easy generation of precise figures (axis labels, etc) that are saved as a vector graphic (pdf), making it scalable for presentations, posters, etc\r\n- The report file can easily be named after the source file with date & time: it is linked to the source code, but avoids overwriting.\r\n- It does not spam your report with code, but it shares the name, so you can look it up fast if needed. \r\n- It is usable on GitHub Wiki's (you need to [create](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28657992/automator-apple-script-to-convert-jpeg-image) .png versions of .pdf - a current limitation of GitHub)\r\n- It natively exports tables from R to Markdown\r\n- It is all achieved in ~ 200 lines of well commented code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discover 4 Yourself!\r\n\r\n-  See it working: Check out a dummy [R script](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/blob/master/Usage_Example_Script.R) \r\n and the [MarkDown report](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/blob/master/Usage_Example_Script/Usage_Example_Script.R.log.md) \r\n it generates inside this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports).\r\n- Check the function documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/wiki)\r\n- Visit the [project's webpage](https://vertesy.github.io/MarkdownReports/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Learn about the markdown format\r\n\r\n- See the power and simplicity of markdown format [explained on Github](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown)\r\n- Checkout some cool markdown editors, like [MOU](http://25.io/mou/), or [markdownpad](http://markdownpad.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n <br/><br/>\r\n#### Cite it via its Digital Object Identifier (DOI): \r\n\r\n\r\n[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.45945.svg)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.45945)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>\r\n[*edit the website*](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/generated_pages/new)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
